"""
The Red Show - A Text-Based Adventure Game

Overview:
The Red Show is a thrilling and immersive text-based adventure game set in a mysterious and eerie circus. Players navigate through various attractions, each offering unique challenges and puzzles. The goal is to collect keys from each attraction to escape the circus, while managing their character's sanity levels.

Game Mechanics:
1. Attractions: The game features three main attractions - Haunted House, Big Top, and House of Mirrors. Each attraction has its own set of challenges and contributes to the story's progression.

2. Sanity System: Players have a 'sanity' meter which fluctuates based on their experiences and choices in the game. Encounters with clowns or failing challenges at attractions can reduce sanity. If sanity drops to zero, the game ends.

3. Movement and Encounters: Players choose between 'sneaking' or 'running' to move towards the next attraction. Sneaking reduces the chance of encounters but takes longer, while running increases encounter chances but is quicker.

4. Puzzle Solving: Each attraction presents puzzles or challenges that players must overcome to collect keys.

5. Random Elements: The game incorporates random elements such as the number of turns to reach an attraction, the type of challenge faced, and the outcomes of certain actions, adding a layer of unpredictability and replayability.

Objective:
The primary objective is to collect keys from all attractions and escape the circus. Players must strategically make choices to maintain their sanity while overcoming the challenges of each attraction.

Endgame:
The game concludes when the player either collects all keys and escapes, thus winning the game, or loses all sanity, resulting in a game over.
The Red Show offers an engaging narrative and gameplay that combines strategy, puzzle-solving, and chance, providing an intriguing experience for players who enjoy text-based adventure games.
