<h2>Description</h2>
The Red Show is a thrilling text-based adventure game that plunges players into a creepy and mysterious circus. As players explore different attractions, they’ll face puzzles, challenges, and encounters that impact their progress and sanity. The goal is to collect keys from each attraction to escape the circus, but players must balance risk and reward as they navigate a world full of eerie surprises.
<br />

<h3>Game Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Three Main Attractions:</b> Explore the Haunted House, Big Top, and House of Mirrors, each with its own set of puzzles and eerie encounters.</li>
  <li><b>Sanity System:</b> Your character’s sanity is crucial. Every encounter with creepy clowns and failed puzzles drains your sanity. If it hits zero, the game ends.</li>
  <li><b>Movement Choices:</b> Choose between sneaking or running to move to the next attraction. Sneaking minimizes encounters but takes longer, while running speeds things up at the cost of more encounters.</li>
  <li><b>Puzzle Solving:</b> Solve unique puzzles and challenges in each attraction to collect keys necessary for escaping.</li>
  <li><b>Randomized Gameplay:</b> Experience unpredictable gameplay with random elements like the number of turns to reach an attraction and random outcomes from your choices.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Objective</h3>
The primary goal of the game is to collect all the keys from the attractions and escape the circus. Players need to manage their choices carefully to maintain their sanity and overcome the obstacles within each attraction. The game ends when the player either escapes by collecting all the keys or loses all their sanity, leading to a game over.

<h2>Main Attractions</h2>
<h3>House of Mirrors</h3>
<p>The attraction features a random mix of riddles and clown encounters. Players must solve riddles to progress while avoiding the disorienting effects of clowns.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Riddles:</b> Players encounter mirrors with a riddle, and must provide the correct answer to proceed. If they answer correctly, they feel closer to finding the key. An incorrect answer drains sanity.</li>
  <li><b>Clowns:</b> Random clown encounters reduce the player’s sanity by 2 points, adding pressure as players navigate through the maze.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sanity Management:</h3>
<p>Sanity plays a central role in the House of Mirrors. As players fail to solve riddles or are startled by clowns, their sanity decreases. If sanity reaches zero, the game ends, and the player is overwhelmed by the eerie environment.</p>

<h3>Key Collection:</h3>
<p>The main objective in this attraction is to find a key by solving riddles and avoiding the sanity-draining effects of the environment. The key is randomly assigned after a correct answer, and the player may not find it after solving a riddle, adding a layer of unpredictability.</p>
<p>Once the key is found, the player regains a bit of sanity and proceeds to the next stage. The player's sanity is capped at 10 points, ensuring they have enough mental fortitude to escape the maze.</p>

<h3>Movement and Choices:</h3>
<p>Players can choose from three directions: left, right, or straight. The direction determines the type of encounter that follows. If an invalid direction is chosen, the game prompts the player to make a valid choice.</p>
